# FloorPlanScaler

Have you ever been in this situation: You're looking at a nice flat online, but the floor plan is unmarked and you have no idea if your bed fits in that corner? Fear noe more, FloorPlanScaler is here to help! Just upload a picture of the room, enter the size of the whole flat and mark where the rooms are.

# Setup

You will need [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current). In a terminal run
```bash
npm install
```
before first use and
```bash
npm run dev
```
to open the app. The command will tell you where you can reach the
site, usually its ` http://localhost:5173/`.
